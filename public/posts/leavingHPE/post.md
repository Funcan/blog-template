Leaving HPE
===========

This week is my last week at HPE, Galway. I've been here just shy of
8 years, worked on 3 major project, met some fantastic people and learnt
a lot. Here's a quick look back at those projects, and a few musings about
each one:

## Public Cloud

This was the project I signed up for, specifically the block storage
component.

## Helion Life-cycle Manager

This was a pivot back towards what HPE knows better: On-premise enterprise
software

## OneSphere

Cloud was clearly still a vital market for HPE, and this was yet another
attempt to bring a product into that space.
