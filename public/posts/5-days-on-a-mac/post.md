5 Days With a Mac
=================

https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/ fixed my external keyboard layout.

Getting used to using cmd+c/v/z/etc is taking time, but it is only retraining my fingers, and it means the same key combos work in terminal too. It would be nice if I can set up XFCE with those keys.

'menu' key doesn't work, minor annoyance for doing things like fixing spelling errors in a browser window without reaching for the mouse.

Home and end in a browser go to page top and bottom, not line beginning & end. Hopefully I can fix that.

Mouse scroll wheel acceleration is an abomination. 

Brew seems alright, I've not done anything serious yet but it got me set up with the basics in short order.

Sometimes my machine gets bogged down, the load average goes up >10 and everything feels slow, but I can't find a culprit.

Finding out which app is making the god awful noise seems impossible without installing random extensions?

Corporate security settings mean I need signed builds, so need to figure out how to sign my own builds for stuff like macdown.

Window management, especially cmd+tab behaviour, seems dumb. Why can't I tab between terminals? That's like 90% of my day.

Slack application is bloated and slow, though that's not mac-specific. I remember there being a good terminal slack client, need to find it again.

Importing my vim config took longer than I liked, but it's working now, and I found a few extra plugins in the process. Should post about my VIM setup separately.

Bash tab-complete customisations seem to work far lass well out-of-the-box than ubuntu, need to investigate more.
