5 Days With a Mac
=================

https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/ fixed my external keyboard layout.

Getting used to using cmd+c/v/z/etc is taking time, but it is only retraining my fingers, and it means the same key combos work in terminal too. It would be nice if I can set up XFCE with those keys.

'menu' key doesn't work, minor annoyance for doing things like fixing spelling errors in a browser window without reaching for the mouse.

Home and end in a browser go to page top and bottom, not line beginning & end. Hopefully I can fix that.

Mouse scroll wheel acceleration is an abomination. 

Brew seems alright, I've not done anything serious yet but it got me set up with the basics in short order.
